Senior design project. It is a stair traversing vacuum cleaner. 
Hinge_movements - contains the hinge controlling code
Macros - cantain all relevant macros used in all of the files
Motor_Code - Contains all code for motor controll and testing
Sensor_Code - contains code which reads sensor values from the IR sensors and creates a buffer
StairSurfer - main loop of the code
StairTravel - contains stair traversing algorithm
Unused - previous code that was used for testing and outdatet code
To run the code, create a folder named StairSurfer or StairSurfer_Test and put all of the files in that folder.
Upload the code to the Arduino Mega
Run by pressing the GOUP (Pin 46) button
